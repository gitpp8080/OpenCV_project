# Face, Eye, Nose, and Smile Detection

This project demonstrates real-time face, eye, nose, and smile detection using Haarcascade classifiers. 
It captures video from the webcam and overlays rectangles on detected facial features. 
The script is written in Python and uses the OpenCV library for computer vision tasks.

you need to have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- OpenCV (cv2) library
- Webcam (if you want to test real-time detection)
